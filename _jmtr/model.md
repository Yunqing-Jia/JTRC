            Leveraging the advantages brought by the connected environment and fully integrating the macroscopic state of mixed traffic flow with the microscopic trajectories of connected buses, the connected bus speed and traffic signals can be integrated into macro-microscopic models of mixed traffic flow to capture traffic flow dynamics more accurately by treating connected buses as moving bottlenecks.
